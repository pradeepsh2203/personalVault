In spring there are three ways to use dependency injection
1. Property Based injection:- using a public value and using @Autowired annotation on the variable itself to do the dependency injection
2. Setter Based Injection:- using a private value and using @Autowired annotation on a setter method to do the dependency injection.
3. Constructer Based Injection:- Using a private final variable and setting it up in the constructor to do the dependency injection without using Autowired annotation
