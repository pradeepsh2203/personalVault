*SOLID stands for*
- **Single Responsibility**
	- Every class should have a single responsibility
	- Your classes should be small
	- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
- **Open Closed Principle**
	- Your classes should be open for extension
	- But closed for modification
	- You should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifications.
	- Use private variables with getters and setters 
	- Use abstract base classes.
- Liskov Substitution Principle
	- Any Child class should be able to perform every task a parent class can do
- Interface Segregation Principle
	- An interface should only contain methods that are closely related so any class implementing that interface does not implement methods that the class will not require
- Dependency Inversion Principle
	- Abstractions should not depend on details.
	- Details should depend upon abstractions.
